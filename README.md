## Description
Website that uses a method to replace vowels in a string with the dash symbol "-" to create a word puzzle to solve.The original user sentence is hidden when  word puzzle is displayed, so that another person can try and guess it.

Example:

String Input: "Believe you can and you're halfway there. Theodore Roosevelt"

Puzzle Output: "B-l--v- y-- c-n -nd y--'r- h-lfw-y th-r-. Th--d-r- R--s-v-lt"

Do this without "regular expressions".

## Objectives
- [] JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.
- [] Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).
- [] Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
- [] Application implements a for loop and works as expected.
All previous objectives have been met.
- [] Project is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README.
- [] Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
- [] Practice styling with imagery and fonts
